# Lab infrastructure

This repository holds infrastructure configuration for different lab environments that can be configured across AWS, GCP and Azure.
It has been designed to be used mainly with acloud.guru's [sandbox environments](https://learn.acloud.guru/cloud-playground/cloud-sandboxes) rather than long standing accounts/projects/subscriptions which is why the structure does not conform to what you might normally see.
